# networklittle

Implementing and learning networking from the sites listed on links. Using the sockets module from python3.

At the same time, learning how to handle errors and exceptions. 



## Objective

Short term objective is to implement simple and minimalistic peer to peer messaging network. More ambitious objectives are to use this network as backbone to some other thing, like a peer to peer game, or for blockchainlittle my another learning repo.

 

## RoadMap
*This road-map is expanded and deepened while I learn new things*

1. First implement and understand the clips on [
2. Implement a simple messaging peer, capable to message to one other peer. 
3. Implement a messaging peer to peer network following Jenkov's tutorial
