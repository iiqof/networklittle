# networklittle

Implementing and learning networking from the sites listed on links. Using the sockets module from python3.

At the same time, learning how to handle errors and exceptions. 



## Objective

Short term objective is to implement simple and minimalistic peer to peer messaging network. More ambitious objectives are to use this network as backbone to some other thing, like a peer to peer game, or for blockchainlittle my another learning repo.

 

## RoadMap
*This road-map is expanded and deepened while I learn new things*

1. First implement and understand some of the clips on [1]
2. Establish a communication channel between two computers in the same LAN.
    - done as of mess_client.py and mess_server.py
3. Learn threading on python to allow multiple messages at the same time.
4. Implement a simple messaging peer, capable to message to one other peer. 
5. Implement a messaging peer to peer network following Jenkov's tutorial
